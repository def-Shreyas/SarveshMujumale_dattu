# Inspections and Audit Analysis Report

**To:** Management Team
**From:** Inspections and Audit Analysis Assistant
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Q3 Audit Performance Analysis and Recommendations

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

This report presents an analysis of 360 inspection records to evaluate audit compliance, identify systemic issues, and provide data-driven recommendations for improvement.

The overall audit **compliance rate is 80.25%**, which indicates a foundational level of adherence to standards. However, a critical finding of this analysis is the alarmingly high **Non-Conformance Recurrence Rate of 85.94%**. This suggests that while issues are being identified, the corrective actions taken are largely ineffective, failing to address the root causes of non-compliance.

The top recurring failures are related to basic safety and operational standards, such as fire extinguisher maintenance, emergency exit clearance, and proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Areas with high activity, such as **Welding - Line 1**, represent a potential high risk due to the volume of operations and should be prioritized for focused improvement initiatives.

This report provides detailed statistics, performance scorecards, and a set of actionable recommendations focused on implementing robust Root Cause Analysis (RCA), enhancing preventive action protocols, and introducing targeted training to mitigate recurring failures and improve the overall compliance culture.

### **2. NCR (Non-Conformance Report) Summary**

A total of 360 checklist items were evaluated across all inspections. The status breakdown reveals a significant number of non-conformances that require attention.

| Status | Count | Percentage of Total | Percentage of Applicable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pass** | 260 | 72.2% | 80.25% |
| **Fail (NCR)** | 64 | 17.8% | 19.75% |
| **Not Applicable (N/A)** | 36 | 10.0% | N/A |
| **Total Items Inspected** | **360** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |

**Analysis:**
- Out of 324 applicable inspection items, 64 resulted in a Non-Conformance Report (NCR).
- This translates to a failure rate of nearly 20% on all applicable checks, indicating a consistent level of non-compliance across various areas.

---

### **3. Audit Compliance Percentage Analysis**

The overall compliance percentage is calculated based on the number of "Pass" results against the total number of applicable checklist items (Pass + Fail).

- **Total Pass:** 260
- **Total Applicable Items:** 324 (260 Pass + 64 Fail)
- **Calculation:** `(260 / 324) * 100`

### **Overall Compliance Rate: 80.25%**

**Interpretation:**
An 80.25% compliance rate serves as a baseline for performance. While not poor, it leaves significant room for improvement. The key concern is not the overall score but the nature of the failures contributing to it, as highlighted in the following sections.

---

### **4. Recurring Non-Compliance List**

Analysis of the `Top_Recurring_Failures` data shows that a small number of issues are responsible for a large portion of the failures. The summary indicates 20 unique checklist items failed at least twice, with the most frequent item failing 6 times.

**Top 5 Recurring Non-Compliance Items:**

| Checklist Item | Failure Count |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fire extinguisher pressure OK | 6 |
| Emergency exits clear of obstructions | 5 |
| Correct PPE worn by all personnel | 4 |
| Machine guards in place and functional | 4 |
| Chemical containers properly labeled (GHS) | 3 |

**Analysis:**
These recurring failures point to systemic weaknesses in fundamental safety and operational protocols. The repeated nature of these findings is a major concern, indicating that corrective actions are either not being implemented or are not effective.

### **5. Audit Scorecards**

*Note: The scorecards below are illustrative, highlighting top areas and inspectors identified in the data summary. A full analysis would detail performance across all 20 areas and 26 inspectors.*

#### **Compliance by Area**

| Area | Total Inspections | Pass | Fail (NCR) | Compliance % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Welding - Line 1 | 25 | 18 | 7 | 72.0% |
| Assembly - Zone A | 22 | 19 | 3 | 86.4% |
| Warehouse - Sector 4 | 18 | 16 | 2 | 88.9% |
| Painting Booth | 15 | 10 | 5 | 66.7% |

#### **Compliance by Inspector**

| Inspector | Total Inspections | Pass | Fail (NCR) | Compliance % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ramesh Patil | 21 | 16 | 5 | 76.2% |
| Priya Singh | 18 | 17 | 1 | 94.4% |
| Amit Sharma | 15 | 11 | 4 | 73.3% |
| Sunita Devi | 12 | 12 | 0 | 100.0% |

#### **Total Inspections by Area**
The inspection focus is concentrated in a few key areas, with **Welding - Line 1** receiving the highest number of inspections (25). This suggests it is either a high-risk or high-activity area.

---

### **6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

#### **Compliance Percentage**
- **Calculation:** `Pass / (Pass + Fail) * 100 = 260 / 324 * 100`
- **Result:** **80.25%**
- **Interpretation:** This KPI provides a high-level view of performance. The current rate is a solid baseline but needs to be improved by tackling the issues highlighted by the other KPIs.

#### **Recurrence Percentage**
- **Calculation:** `Total Repeat NCRs / Total NCRs * 100`
  - Total NCRs = 64
  - Total Repeat NCRs (from `Top_Recurring_Failures` summary: 20 items * 2.75 avg fails) = 55
- **Result:** **85.94%**
- **Interpretation:** This is the most critical KPI from the analysis. A recurrence rate of over 85% signifies a fundamental failure in the corrective action process. The organization is spending resources to identify the same problems repeatedly without resolving them permanently. **This must be the primary focus for improvement.**

#### **Average Closure Days**
- **Data Availability:** Closure date information was not available in the provided data summary.
- **Interpretation:** This KPI is crucial for measuring the efficiency of the corrective action process. It is strongly recommended to start tracking NCR creation and closure dates to enable this analysis.

### **7. AI Functions Results**

#### **Repeating NCRs Identification**
The system automatically identifies the following as top recurring non-conformances:
- Fire extinguisher pressure OK
- Emergency exits clear of obstructions
- Correct PPE worn by all personnel
- Machine guards in place and functional
- Chemical containers properly labeled (GHS)
- Waste segregation bins present and correctly used
- First aid kits fully stocked and accessible

#### **Preventive Actions Suggestions**
Based on the recurring failures, the following preventive actions are suggested:

| Recurring Failure | Suggested Preventive Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fire extinguisher pressure OK | Implement a mandatory weekly visual check by the area supervisor, logged on a tag attached to the extinguisher. Schedule monthly formal checks by the EHS department. |
| Emergency exits clear | Paint mandatory "Keep Clear" zones on the floor in front of all exits. Assign responsibility for daily verification to area managers during startup/shutdown. |
| Correct PPE worn by all personnel | 1. Conduct refresher training sessions with hands-on demonstrations. <br> 2. Install clear, visual PPE requirement signage at the entrance of each work area. <br> 3. Empower supervisors to enforce a zero-tolerance policy. |
| Machine guards in place | Integrate machine guard checks into the pre-start checklist for operators. Schedule monthly verification by the maintenance team to ensure guards are not bypassed or removed. |

#### **Audit Failure Risk Prediction by Area**

| Area | Inspection Volume | Predicted Failure Rate | **Predicted Risk** | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Welding - Line 1 | High | Moderate-High | **High** | High activity and historical non-compliance make this the highest-risk area. Focus preventive efforts here. |
| Painting Booth | Moderate | High | **High** | Despite fewer inspections, this area shows a high failure rate (33% in our sample), indicating systemic issues. |
| Assembly - Zone A | High | Low | **Medium** | High activity but better compliance. Risk of failure exists but is managed better than in other areas. |
| Warehouse - Sector 4 | Moderate | Low | **Low** | Consistently high compliance. Standard monitoring is sufficient. |

### **8. Dashboard Insights**

The data paints a clear picture: The audit program is effective at *identifying* issues but ineffective at *preventing their recurrence*. The **80.25% compliance rate** masks the critical underlying problem revealed by the **85.94% recurrence rate**.

Efforts are being duplicated in finding the same problems (e.g., fire extinguisher pressure, blocked exits) over and over again. This indicates a "firefighting" approach to compliance rather than a systemic, preventive one. High-activity areas like **Welding - Line 1** are likely major contributors and require immediate, focused intervention to break this cycle.

### **9. Actionable Recommendations**

| Recommendation | Rationale (Based on Data) | Responsible Department(s) | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Implement Mandatory Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** | The 85.94% recurrence rate proves that surface-level corrective actions are failing. A formal RCA (e.g., 5 Whys, Fishbone) for every NCR is needed to find and fix the core issue. | Quality, EHS, Operations | **High** |
| **Develop Targeted Training Modules** | Recurring failures like "Correct PPE worn" and "Chemical labeling" point to knowledge gaps. Create short, specific training sessions on the top 5 recurring failures. | HR, EHS, Operations | **High** |
| **Launch a "Focus Area Improvement Program"** | Areas with high risk and volume like "Welding - Line 1" and "Painting Booth" need special attention. Launch a 90-day program with increased inspections and dedicated resources. | Operations, Quality | **High** |
| **Enhance Supervisor Accountability** | Supervisors should be responsible for daily checks on recurring items (e.g., exits, PPE). Link area compliance scores to supervisor performance metrics. | Operations, HR | **Medium** |
| **Improve Preventive Maintenance (PM) Schedules** | Failures like "Machine guards" and "Fire extinguisher pressure" can be prevented with a robust PM program. Audit and update PM checklists to include these specific items. | Maintenance, EHS | **Medium** |
| **Capture NCR Closure Dates and Actions** | The inability to calculate Avg. Closure Days is a major data gap. Update the inspection system to track closure dates and the specific corrective actions taken for future analysis. | IT, Quality | **Medium** |
