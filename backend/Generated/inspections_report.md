### **1. Executive Summary**

This report provides a detailed analysis of 360 inspection records to evaluate audit compliance, identify systemic weaknesses, and offer actionable recommendations.

The overall audit compliance rate stands at **80.25%**, which indicates a foundational level of adherence to standards. However, the analysis reveals a critical area of concern: the **Non-Conformance Report (NCR) Recurrence Rate is an alarming 85.94%**. This extremely high percentage signifies that when failures occur, they are overwhelmingly repeat issues. This points to a systemic failure in implementing effective and sustainable corrective actions for previously identified non-conformances.

The top recurring failures, with some items failing up to 6 times, are concentrated in areas that require immediate attention. This report breaks down performance by area and inspector, introduces key performance indicators (KPIs), and leverages AI-driven analysis to predict risks and suggest targeted preventive actions. The primary recommendation is to overhaul the corrective action process, focusing on root cause analysis and verification of effectiveness to break the cycle of recurring failures.

### **2. NCR (Non-Conformance Report) Summary**

A total of 360 checklist items were inspected. Of these, 324 were applicable and resulted in a "Pass" or "Fail" status.

| Status | Count | Percentage of Total (360) | Percentage of Applicable (324) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pass** | 260 | 72.2% | 80.25% |
| **Fail (NCR)** | 64 | 17.8% | 19.75% |
| **Not Applicable (NA)** | 36 | 10.0% | - |
| **Total** | **360** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |

**Analysis:**
- While the majority of inspections passed, the 64 non-conformances represent significant opportunities for improvement.
- The high number of failures directly impacts operational risk, safety, and quality standards.

### **3. Audit Compliance Percentage Analysis**

The overall compliance percentage is calculated based on the number of "Pass" results against the total number of applicable inspections (Pass + Fail).

- **Total Applicable Inspections:** 324
- **Total Pass:** 260
- **Compliance Percentage:** `(260 / 324) * 100 =` **80.25%**

A compliance rate of 80.25% suggests that processes are followed correctly most of the time. However, a rate below 90-95% is often a leading indicator of potential systemic issues, which is confirmed by the high recurrence rate detailed later in this report.

### **4. Recurring Non-Compliance List**

The data on recurring failures highlights the most significant and persistent issues within the operations.

- **Total Distinct Recurring Failures:** 20 checklist items.
- **Failure Frequency:** These items failed between **2 to 6 times** each.
- **Top Recurring Failure:** The most frequent non-conformance failed **6 times**.

While the specific checklist items are not detailed in the summary, the analysis confirms that a core group of 20 issues is responsible for a large portion of the total failures. These are not isolated incidents but chronic problems.

### **5. Audit Scorecards**

#### Compliance by Area
There are **20 unique areas** under inspection. A detailed breakdown by area is critical for targeted interventions. For example, the **Welding - Line 1** area had the highest number of inspections (25). Areas with high inspection volumes and recurring failures should be prioritized.

*(Note: A full scorecard requires raw data, but a template is below.)*

| Area | Total Inspections | Pass | Fail | Compliance % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Welding - Line 1 | 25 | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* |
| Area B | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* |
| ... (18 more) | ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### Compliance by Inspector
There are **26 unique inspectors** conducting audits. Analyzing performance by inspector can help identify needs for calibration, training, or clarification on audit standards. For example, Inspector **Ramesh Patil** conducted the most inspections (21).

*(Note: A full scorecard requires raw data, but a template is below.)*

| Inspector | Total Inspections | Pass | Fail | Compliance % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ramesh Patil | 21 | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* |
| Inspector Y | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* | *(data needed)* |
| ... (24 more) | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### **6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI | Calculation | Result | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compliance Percentage** | `(Pass / Total Applicable) * 100` | **80.25%** | **Moderate.** Indicates that baseline processes are generally followed, but there is significant room for improvement to achieve excellence. |
| **Recurrence Percentage** | `(Repeat NCR / Total NCR) * 100` | **85.94%** | **CRITICAL.** An extremely high rate, showing that 55 out of 64 failures were repeat issues. This is the most critical finding, indicating that corrective actions are ineffective or not being implemented at all. |
| **Avg. Closure Days** | `Sum(Closure Date - NCR Date) / Total NCR` | **N/A** | **Data Not Available.** The dataset does not include NCR closure dates. This is a critical metric to track for ensuring timely resolution of issues. |

### **7. AI Functions Results**

#### Repeating NCRs Identification
The system has automatically identified **20 distinct checklist items** that are repeatedly failing. These items account for 55 of the 64 total NCRs. The top recurring items include:
- A checklist item that has failed **6 times**.
- Multiple items that have failed **3 to 5 times**.
- The remaining items have failed at least **2 times**.

#### Preventive Actions Suggestions
Based on common recurring failures in industrial settings (e.g., fire safety, waste management, equipment checks), the following preventive actions are suggested:

- **For Equipment Checks (e.g., "Fire extinguisher pressure OK"):**
    - Implement a **digital checklist system** for weekly checks by area supervisors, with mandatory photo uploads.
    - Schedule **monthly preventive maintenance** with a third-party vendor instead of relying solely on internal visual checks.
- **For Process Adherence (e.g., "Waste segregation bins present"):**
    - Conduct mandatory **30-minute refresher training sessions** for all staff on proper waste segregation.
    - Use **color-coded, graphical signage** at all waste disposal points to reduce ambiguity.
    - Appoint "Area Champions" responsible for monitoring compliance daily.

#### Audit Failure Risk Prediction by Area
Based on historical patterns and the high recurrence rate, the risk of future audit failures is predicted as follows:

- **High Risk:**
    - **Welding - Line 1:** As the most frequently inspected area, it has a higher probability of exhibiting one of the recurring failures. The complexity of welding operations often involves multiple compliance points.
    - **Any Area with a Historically Recurring NCR:** Areas where the top recurring failures (those failing 4-6 times) were recorded are at extremely high risk of a repeat failure.
- **Medium Risk:**
    - Areas with high operational tempo but with a lower historical NCR count. They are at risk if the systemic issues identified are not addressed organization-wide.
- **Low Risk:**
    - Areas with simple processes and a consistent history of passing inspections. However, they remain at risk from systemic issues if not addressed.

### **8. Dashboard Insights**

The key insight from this analysis is the stark contrast between the acceptable compliance rate (80.25%) and the critical recurrence rate (85.94%). This suggests a reactive "fix-it-for-the-audit" culture rather than a proactive, preventative one.

- **The Problem is Not New:** We are not facing a wide variety of new issues. We are consistently failing at resolving the same, known problems.
- **Ineffective Corrective Actions:** The 85.94% recurrence rate is direct evidence that the current process for root cause analysis and implementing corrective actions is broken. Fixes are likely superficial and do not address the underlying cause.
- **Resource Misallocation:** Time and resources are being wasted on repeatedly identifying and "fixing" the same issues instead of investing in permanent solutions.

### **9. Actionable Recommendations**

The following actions are recommended to address the findings of this report, with a primary focus on reducing the NCR recurrence rate.

| # | Recommendation | Specific Actions | Owner | Priority |
| :- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Overhaul the Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Process** | 1. Mandate a formal Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for every NCR, using methods like 5 Whys or Fishbone diagrams. <br> 2. Require sign-off on the effectiveness of any implemented solution 30 days post-implementation. <br> 3. Track CAPA closures in a centralized system. | Quality Assurance Manager | **High** |
| **2** | **Targeted Training on Top Recurring Failures** | 1. Develop and deploy mandatory micro-learning modules for the top 5 recurring NCRs. <br> 2. Conduct practical, on-the-floor "toolbox talks" in high-risk areas like Welding - Line 1. | Training Dept. / Area Supervisors | **High** |
| **3** | **Enhance Accountability through Area Ownership** | 1. Assign "Compliance Stewards" for each of the 20 operational areas. <br> 2. Link a portion of the area supervisor's performance review to the area's audit compliance and NCR recurrence rate. | Operations Director | **Medium** |
| **4** | **Implement a Leading Indicator KPI: "Days to Close NCR"** | 1. Modify the inspection system to capture NCR closure dates. <br> 2. Establish a target of <7 days for closing minor NCRs and <30 days for major NCRs. <br> 3. Review this KPI in weekly management meetings. | IT / Quality Assurance | **Medium** |
| **5** | **Increase Audit Frequency in High-Risk Areas** | 1. Double the frequency of spot-checks and internal audits in areas identified as "High Risk." <br> 2. Use a focused checklist that specifically targets the known recurring failures for that area. | Internal Audit Team | **Low** |
