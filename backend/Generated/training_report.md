### **5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

KPIs provide a quantitative measure of the training program's performance.

#### **A. Coverage Percentage**
*   **Formula:** (Unique Employees Trained / Total Employees) × 100
*   **Calculation:** (95 / 150) × 100 = **63.3%**
*   **Interpretation:** While a majority of employees have received some form of training, **36.7% of the workforce remains untrained**. This gap could lead to inconsistent skills and performance across the organization. Efforts should be made to expand training reach.

#### **B. Training Effectiveness**
*   **Formula:** Average (Post-Training Score – Pre-Training Score)
*   **Calculation:** 72.73 (Avg Post-Score) – 56.34 (Avg Pre-Score) = **+16.39 points**
*   **Interpretation:** This is a strong positive indicator. On average, employees' scores improve by over 16 points after training, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer and learning.

#### **C. Expiry Compliance Percentage**
*   **Formula:** (Total Valid Certifications / Total Certifications) × 100
*   **Calculation:** (133 Valid / 180 Total) × 100 = **73.9%**
*   **Interpretation:** An expiry compliance rate of 73.9% is a significant concern. With **26.1% of certifications expired or invalid**, the organization is exposed to operational and legal risks, particularly in safety-critical roles.
